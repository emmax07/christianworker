        The church of Christ was originally established on the day of Pentecost,
        A.D. 33. The central guidance for churches of Christ is provided by the
        Lord from heaven. Local congregations are led by elders in accordance
        with the New Testament (Titus 1:5-9; 1 Timothy 3:1-15). The practices
        and teachings of each congregation are based solely on the Holy
        Scriptures, which equip us fully for every good work (2 Timothy
        3:14-17). The directories are attempts by certain brethren and
        congregations to assist travelers and those searching for a congregation
        in their community. Various criteria have been used in compiling these
        lists, and no list can be complete or entirely reliable. The location of
        various congregations of the church of Christ in the UK and Ireland can
        be found on this site. This is to make it as easy as possible to search
        for and find groups of Christians who are seeking to worship God in the
        way described in the Holy Bible. To search for any congregation, click
        on the Church Directory or Church Search.

      <h3>How does one become a member of the church of Christ?</h3>
      <p>
        In the salvation of man's soul, there are two necessary parts: God's
        part and man's part. God's part is the big part: "For by grace you have
        been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of
        God; not of works, that no man should glory" (Ephesians 2:8-9). The love
        which God felt for man led Him to send Christ into the world to redeem
        man. The life and teaching of Jesus, the sacrifice on the cross, and the
        proclaiming of the gospel to men constitute God's part in salvation.
        Though God's part is the big part, man's part is also necessary if man
        is to reach heaven. Man must comply with the conditions of pardon which
        the Lord has announced. Man's part can be clearly set forth in the
        following steps:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Hear the Gospel:</strong> "How shall they call on him whom
          they have not believed? And how shall they believe him whom they have
          not heard? And how shall they hear without a preacher?" (Romans
          10:14).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Believe:</strong> "And without faith it is impossible to be
          well pleasing unto him; for he that cometh to God must believe that he
          is, and that he is a rewarder of them that seek after him" (Hebrews
          11:6).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Repent of past sins:</strong> "The times of ignorance
          therefore God overlooked; but now he commandeth men that they should
          all everywhere repent" (Acts 17:30).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Confess Jesus as Lord:</strong> "Behold, here is water; what
          doth hinder me to be baptized? And Philip said, If thou believest with
          all thy heart, thou mayest. And he answered and said, I believe that
          Jesus Christ is the Son of God" (Acts 8:36-37).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Be baptized for the remission of sins:</strong> "And Peter
          said unto them, Repent ye, and be baptized every one of you in the
          name of Jesus Christ unto the remission of your sins, and ye shall
          receive the gift of the Holy Spirit" (Acts 2:38).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Live a Christian life:</strong> "Ye are an elect race, a royal
          priesthood, a holy nation, a people for God's own possession, that ye
          may show forth the excellencies of him who called you out of darkness
          into his marvelous light" (1 Peter 2:9).
